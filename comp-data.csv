15,"星の間に自由 ✦ ""Free Among the Stars""",2023,"all, chamber, handbells, xenharmonic","Solo Lumatone, Handbell + Handchimes choir (G2-D8 Handbells, G2-C8 Handchimes)","Handbells, Handchimes, Lumatone","""Free Among the Stars"" or ""星の間に自由"" was written for the St. Olaf Handbell Choir and was taken on Handbell Choir Misdwest tour from March 3 to March 6. This is the Home Concert performance performed in Urness Hall in St. Olaf College Christiansen Hall of Music on March 6, 2023.
 
I had so much fun writing this piece but it really was a daunting task. For starters, I had never written for handbell choir. I had also never written for lumatone, heck, I didn't even know how to play it properly let a alone be ready to perform in front of many people! You can probably see why I wrote a rather east part for the lumatone and a more difficult part for the handbell choir. I used Vital as the Synth Engine and tuned it to A=438.36Hz dividing the octave into 31 equal parts (aka 31-EDO, 31-TET, 31-ED2, 31-ED(2/1) etc.) using a .tun file",https://www.youtube.com/embed/hCBY7gyjIvY?si=1zDmpMJG7RdqHLRp
16, تقسیم ناچ ✦ Taqsim Nach for Clarinet Nonet,2023,"all, chamber, xenharmonic","E♭ Clarinet, 3 B♭ Clarinets, 1 E♭ Alto Clarinet, 2 B♭ Bass Clarinets, 1 E♭ Contra-alto Clarinet, 1 B♭ Contrabass Clarinet","E♭ Clarinet, B♭ Clarinet, Alto Clarinet, Bass Clarinet, Contra-Alto Clarinet, Contrabass Clarinet","I was requested to write this piece by my friend Emma (Playing 1st B♭ Clarinet). I had a lot of fun writing his piece but I had even more fun rehearsing and performing it as all 9 players are very close friends of mine. We are all clarinet players in the St. Olaf Band, so this, in some way, is a celebration of my lovely clarinet section in band.
 
The title of the piece is actually a combination of 2 languages, ""Taqsim"" is an Arabic word which in the context of music refers to a form which involves improvisational passages and recurring theme. ""Nach"" simple means dance in Hindi. Pieces in Arabic and Turkish and other middle eastern music are often titled this way (""Taqsim ___""). The title perfectly sums up the mixture of influences stemming from my deep appreciation of Arabic and Turkish music and my Indian heritage.
 
Taking a lot of inspiration from Arabic and Turkish music, I used maqams which use quarter tones (In this case, I used Maqam Bayati and altered it occasionally). Unsurprisingly, they're very hard on clarinet and require embouchure manipulation and alternate fingerings. My friends worked very hard to practice those quarter tones for my piece and I am super pleased with the result. I also took inspiration from Klezmer music with some scales and rhythm. Hope you enjoy my piece!
 
A very special thanks to Prof. Scott Anderson. He's the clarinet prof at St. Olaf College and he oversaw most of the rehearsals and provided invaluable advice and support so the piece could be performed well. (He also really helped out with the smears and the quarter tones).",https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBK5SfeWuQs?si=ciJ0K8yEPRsArEdb&amp;start=245
