The title “No One’s an Island” was inspired by the evocative poem “No Man’s an Island” by 16th Century Poet “John Donne”. The poem serves as a reminder that no human in society is self-sufficient, and how we are where we are because of the people around us. 
The poem reads:

“No man is an island entire of itself; every man 
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; 
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe 
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine 
own were; any man's death diminishes me, 
because I am involved in mankind. 
And therefore never send to know for whom 
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.”

The poem resonates with my personal emotions based on recent events, and I decided to write a piece on this topic to express gratitude to the people around me who have helped me through tough times. The soloist in the piece represents the protagonist, with the accompanying 10 horns acting as company, friends, or relatives.
The piece starts with the soloist playing a short motif with the other horns echoing after the soloist. This is to signify the soloist in despair as they think that they have to suffer alone through their hardships and all their calls for help merely echo into the distance. This is followed by the soloist introducing the main theme of the piece played in natural horn. The echoing concept is further explored as the piece progresses. The piece musically expresses the accompanying horns trying to help the soloist while the soloist avoids and rejects it as they are adamant to deal with the ordeal by themselves. However, the staggering and echoing horns slowly converge until finally all the accompanying horns and the soloist are playing together in harmony and with identical rhythms to signify the acceptance of asking for and receiving help. 
This piece was requested by Siena Olson and is dedicated to the St. Olaf Horn Club.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/WjnocpwD16w?si=CVy15ghDW9IJKjad
15,"星の間に自由 ✦ ""Free Among the Stars""",2023,"all, chamber, handbells, xenharmonic","Solo Lumatone, Handbell + Handchimes choir (G2-D8 Handbells, G2-C8 Handchimes)","Handbells, Handchimes, Lumatone","""Free Among the Stars"" or ""星の間に自由"" was written for the St. Olaf Handbell Choir and was taken on Handbell Choir Misdwest tour from March 3 to March 6. This is the Home Concert performance performed in Urness Hall in St. Olaf College Christiansen Hall of Music on March 6, 2023.
 
I had so much fun writing this piece but it really was a daunting task. For starters, I had never written for handbell choir. I had also never written for lumatone, heck, I didn't even know how to play it properly let a alone be ready to perform in front of many people! You can probably see why I wrote a rather east part for the lumatone and a more difficult part for the handbell choir. I used Vital as the Synth Engine and tuned it to A=438.36Hz dividing the octave into 31 equal parts (aka 31-EDO, 31-TET, 31-ED2, 31-ED(2/1) etc.) using a .tun file",https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBK5SfeWuQs?si=ciJ0K8yEPRsArEdb&amp;start=245
16, تقسیم ناچ ✦ Taqsim Nach for Clarinet Nonet,2023,"all, chamber, xenharmonic","E♭ Clarinet, 3 B♭ Clarinets, 1 E♭ Alto Clarinet, 2 B♭ Bass Clarinets, 1 E♭ Contra-alto Clarinet, 1 B♭ Contrabass Clarinet","E♭ Clarinet, B♭ Clarinet, Alto Clarinet, Bass Clarinet, Contra-Alto Clarinet, Contrabass Clarinet","I was requested to write this piece by my friend Emma (Playing 1st B♭ Clarinet). I had a lot of fun writing his piece but I had even more fun rehearsing and performing it as all 9 players are very close friends of mine. We are all clarinet players in the St. Olaf Band, so this, in some way, is a celebration of my lovely clarinet section in band.
 
The title of the piece is actually a combination of 2 languages, ""Taqsim"" is an Arabic word which in the context of music refers to a form which involves improvisational passages and recurring theme. ""Nach"" simple means dance in Hindi. Pieces in Arabic and Turkish and other middle eastern music are often titled this way (""Taqsim ___""). The title perfectly sums up the mixture of influences stemming from my deep appreciation of Arabic and Turkish music and my Indian heritage.
 
Taking a lot of inspiration from Arabic and Turkish music, I used maqams which use quarter tones (In this case, I used Maqam Bayati and altered it occasionally). Unsurprisingly, they're very hard on clarinet and require embouchure manipulation and alternate fingerings. My friends worked very hard to practice those quarter tones for my piece and I am super pleased with the result. I also took inspiration from Klezmer music with some scales and rhythm. Hope you enjoy my piece!
 
A very special thanks to Prof. Scott Anderson. He's the clarinet prof at St. Olaf College and he oversaw most of the rehearsals and provided invaluable advice and support so the piece could be performed well. (He also really helped out with the smears and the quarter tones).",https://www.youtube.com/embed/hCBY7gyjIvY?si=1zDmpMJG7RdqHLRp
