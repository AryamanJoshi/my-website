Our assignment was to compose for a short film, which is awesome because that's kinda what I want to explore/do with my compositions. As mentioned in the video, I've used 31-TET for the background score. I've been dabbling a bit in microtonality (*ahem* remember what I said in my last video?) and thought it would be a cool idea to use microtonality for my project. All composition and MIDI realization was done on MuseScore. Some  dialogues (especially scene 1) may have poor audio quality, that's because I removed the original BGM with Audacity.

Another thing I want to point out is my use of Gamelan. I took a musicology course side by side with this course and we had a section on Javanese Gamelan. I was really enamoured by it's sound and wanted to explore more of it. I have heavily appropriated the instrument to support a Western setting, which I understand may raise a few eyebrows.

The main girl is from the future. She is unable to see colour. She went back in time using magic and ended up in the main boy’s house. She quickly escapes but the boy suspects that his room was broken into and tries to find the culprit. The girl drops a piece of jewellery at the boy’s house and uses magic to find the location of it. When following the boy to ask him for her jewellery, she notices that she can see colour in the guy's drawings. She is overcome by emotion and joy.

,9,Babysitting,2021,"all, chamber","Piano, Trumpet, Voice, Violin, Viola","Piano, Trumpet, Voice, Violin, Viola","This is my first attempt at writing a post-tonal piece and it was a lot of fun. One thing I tried while composing this was “speed-running”, which is writing the piece as quickly as one can and not being allowed to erase a note once it’s written. I ended up writing the piece in 1.5 hours. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I wanted to write a 12-Tone row piece, so I googled a random number generator and was given the tone row: 7 3 2 5 1 E 8 0 T 6 4 9. I decided to establish this tone row with a loud and strong introduction with the piano in the first two bars. That piano motif also established the rhythmic pattern which recurs throughout the piece. As the composition began to take shape, I started to get more chaotic and slightly derpy vibes from the music and was, for some reason, reminded of babysitting a hyperactive toddler. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I ended up continuing to write my piece accordingly. The lyrics are reflective of the babysitter getting very stressed with the toddler. Towards the end (bar 22 onwards), the lyrics repeat “I’m so done” along with the violin viola and piano playing a staccato tone row which slowly rises in pitch. This was done to show the increase in frustration and almost reaching a breaking point. Finally, the main theme returns and this time the tone row ends in a perfect cadence. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Note that the rules didn’t have to be broken too much to write the perfect cadence as I still employed the first 2 notes of various tone rows to achieve that. The perfect cadence along with the “I’m free!” was meant to reflect the parents of the toddler coming back and the babysitter leaving the house after being paid $29 (Can you guess why?).",https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uf-WToAZMo?si=1RD7hDfoBsoMViKu,,1'

<br>&nbsp;<br>
“Nix, also called nixie, or nixy, in Germanic mythology, a water being, half-human, half-fish, that lives in a beautiful underwater palace and mingles with humans by assuming a variety of physical forms (e.g., that of a fair maiden or an old woman) or by making itself invisible. One of three attributes may betray the disguises of nixes: they are music lovers and excellent dancers, and they have the gift of prophecy. Usually malevolent, a nix can easily be
propitiated with gifts. In some regions, nixes are said to abduct human children and lure people into deep water to drown. According to some sources, nixes can marry human beings and bear human children.”
<br>&nbsp;<br>
People who know me, know very well how obsessed I am with fish and aquatic life. I sometimes wish I were half-human half-fish so I could swim with fish. I tried to capture this emotion with this piece. The setting I was imagining was a large lake with diverse aquatic life. The Nix resides in that lake and is the king. The A section describes the Nix being joyful and dancing on the lake. Section B starts with the Nix showing off some tricks and going in and out of the water. The calmer part of Section B is the Nix diving underwater and swimming and dancing with the diverse life in the pond. Section A returns and the Nix comes out of the water and resumes his lively dance. He finishes his dance with a magical and virtuosic display of colour and manipulating water. The piece is in ternary form. Section A and A’ is roughly in F Aeolian and Section B is roughly in F Dorian. One can find a lot of modal interchanges, planing, non-functional harmony, polychords and quartal and quintal harmony scattered around the piece",https://www.youtube.com/embed/lcMhfDaeze8?si=UUln_CfCWwIA_oVJ,,"1' 30"""

Program Notes:<br>
Kaalachakra, The Wheel of Time pays homage to all the lives lost during the second wave of COVID-19 that hit India in May 2021, making the death toll reach a grim 400,000. “<span class=""hindi_text"">कालचक्र</span>” (kaalachakra (IPA: /’kɐləcəkr/ ) is a journey that takes the listener from chaos in India to a moment of prayer and tribute to the departed. The 11-minute piece has three distinct sections: Chaos, Tribute, Hope. The piece has elements of Indian music, featuring traditional ragas from Hindustani classical music, traditional instruments, and verses in Sanskrit.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Chaos section is a dramatic and loud start to the piece. This section features breathy sounds sprinkled across, telling the story of the oxygen crisis during the second wave, where people had limited supply of oxygen tanks due to the sheer spike of serious cases. The second part of this section transitions into a Traditional Dhol-Tasha beat from the state of Maharashtra. Often danced to, this beat is energetic. Hence, this part of the section can be considered “a dance with death.”
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Tribute section contrasts from the first section, being a slower paced section. The performers repeatedly chant “Om Namo Narayanaaya” (“We pray to lord Narayana”), which is a phrase often dedicated to the departed. This section features traditional instruments like the Ghatam and the finger cymbals. The beat produced by the instruments is inspired by Bhajan music, which is a type of communal devotional singing involving repetition of phrases. The performers also sing a verse from the sacred Hindu book Bhagwad Gita which talks about the Hindu concept of rebirth, and how the “death” is merely the transfer of souls, and the soul never perishes. This alludes to the concept of time being cyclic in Hinduism and is the inspiration for the title of this piece. <br>&nbsp;<br>

“For one who has taken his birth, death is certain; and for one who is <br>

duty, you should not lament.” <br>&nbsp;<br>
This section is dedicated to my grandfather, who passed away in 2019.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The piece closes with the Hope section, which contains evocative melodies and a grand ending. One can hear solidified and developed versions of the motifs sprinkled throughout the first and second section. This section has a more celebratory feel to it with happier and more “human” melodies and musical moments. The ending, while grand and positive, still contains elements of chaos to signify that we are far from the end of the pandemic. This section also contains lyrics which appear after a poignant and sorrowful part of this section:<br>&nbsp;<br>

The story goes like this: 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
“Once upon a time there lived a jackal who strayed into a city in search of food. He was hungry and was being chased by a group of dogs. He accidentally entered the house of a dyer and fell  into a vat of indigo (blue) and was stained blue from head to toe. When he escaped from the house back into the jungle, all animals were surprised at his appearance and could not place its  identity. Taking advantage of the situation, the jackal decided to play the situation to his  advantage. He proclaimed that he was “Fierce Owl”, sent by the king of Gods, Indra, to earth to guard the jungle. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The gullible animals believed the jackal. The jackal then appointed the lion as his prime minister, tiger as his guardian of the bedchamber and the elephant was made the door keeper.  He then drove all the jackals out of sight from the jungle for fear of being recognized. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The animals would hunt food and bring it to the self-proclaimed king and the king would distribute the food to all equally just as a king would do. So, he was leading a life of luxury. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
One day a herd of jackals were passing by howling to their glory. Unable to control his natural  instinct, Fierce-Owl showed his natural voice and howled at the top of his voice. Hearing this  howl, the animals realized that they had been fooled by a jackal and banished the jackal from the jungle.” (Versions differ where the jackal is killed in the end) 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I’m not sure what moral this story was trying to convey. Don’t lie? Fake it till you make it? Either way, I grew up listening to this folktale and it’s a core memory from my childhood. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
For those who don’t know what a jackal is, it’s basically a small wild dog found in South Asia and Africa. They have a distinctive howl which is like a wolf howl but an octave higher (piccolo wolf!?). The piece features jackal howls made by violins and trombones. The scoop up to a high note and a slow fall done by the instruments is a close imitation of how a jackal howl sounds. The growling saxophones and trombones are meant to be the dogs that are chasing the jackal. The piece starts with waves of notes played by the celesta and the piano. This imitates the nimbleness of the jackal and how it is scampering around the jungle looking for food but also trying to avoid predators. This ‘wave’ of notes is reintroduced much later in the piece, this time reinforced with many other instruments to show the change in the demeanor of the jackal as he is crowned king by the animals in the jungle. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The rhythms and scales used in the piece are inspired by the varieties of traditional Indian folk music. The main melody uses a pentatonic scale and a distinct rhythm pattern that is prevalent across the various kinds of folk music in India. Here, compound meter the rhythm is felt as (suppose it’s 6/8):  <strong>1</strong>-<strong>2</strong>-3 | <strong>1</strong>-<strong>2</strong>-3 as opposed to the typical swing in western music which people are more likely to be familiar with:  (<strong>1</strong>-2-<strong>3</strong> | <strong>1</strong>-2-<strong>3</strong>). Typically, phrases start with 2 notes accented at (<strong>1</strong>-2-<strong>3</strong>) before reverting back to the (<strong>1</strong>-<strong>2</strong>-3) accent pattern. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Try familiarizing yourself with the story and try to figure out which part of the piece corresponds to which part of the story!",https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyJGnhCM5mw?si=xD5m3QuxJ5rFv-uO,,11'
,13,"<span class=""hindi_body"">गाने वाला गधा</span> ✦ <em>The Singing Donkey</em>",2022,"all, solo, xenharmonic",Double-Bell-Quarter-Tone Trumpet,Trumpet,"The piece is written for the Double-Bell Quarter-Tone Trumpet and includes scales unique to 24-Tone Equal Temperament (or 24-TET and its multiples). The Panchatantra is an ancient book of fables with morals. Today, it is used as a medium to teach children morals through entertaining fables passed down through the generations. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The singing donkey is a short but sweet story from this collection, here’s a short summary of the story:
“A washer man’s donkey would be free to graze on the green field, after a hard day’s work. Instead of staying on the field, he would sneak into the villagers’ farms and eat the vegetables growing, before sneaking back home. The donkey met a jackal, and they became good friends. They decided to hunt together, and the fat donkey would break the fence to eat vegetables, while the jackal hunted the farm animals. One night, the donkey told the jackal that he felt like singing. The jackal pleaded with him not to sing, as they would get caught. However, the donkey got annoyed and insisted on singing. He opened his mouth and began to bray loudly, and the jackal immediately ran away. The farmers, on hearing the donkey bray, came rushing out and thrashed him for eating their vegetables. The farmers tied a mortar on the donkey, and as he walked home, the jackal joked about the farmers gifting the donkey a necklace for his singing.” Moral: There’s a time and place for everything. (Source: parenting.firstcry.com)
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The piece goes through the various events of the story. It starts with a motif that imitates the braying of a donkey. The low notes and the high notes imitate the “haw” and the “hee” respectively. The main melody is introduced after that. This melody uses a scale that’s only possible in 24-Tone Equal Temperament and can be played using the quarter tone mechanism of a double-bell quarter-tone trumpet. The scale is a modified aeolian scale with the 2nd degree a quarter tone flat and the 7th degree a quarter tone sharp. Even with just two notes different, the scale sounds very odd*(See note Below). (Or how we microtonalists like to say, “xen”) 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
In Bar 42, a new theme is introduced. This is the entry of the calm and graceful jackal. It also introduces a new scale. The step size of each interval is 5 quarter tones, which is exactly half a perfect 4th from 12-TET. The result is an odd pentatonic-like scale very which is reminiscent of 5-TET or even the Slendro Scale from Javanese Gamelan. It’s a non-octave scale and the octave is exceeded by a quarter tone after 5 consecutive steps.** Bar 52 introduces a motive that is a direct reference to the main melody of the first piece in the Panchatantra series called “The Blue Jackal”. The original melody is in a Minor Pentatonic scale, so it is interesting listening to the same motif in the new “xen” pentatonic scale. This “Jackal Motif” returns while being juxtaposed with the “Donkey Motifs”, alluding to a conversation between them. In bar 58, a motif previously stated by the Donkey is reintroduced but this time using an octatonic scale. This scale has a step size of 3 quarter tones (or exactly half a 12-TET minor 3rd) and is basically 8-TET, or 8 equal divisions of the octave. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
In Bar 101, the piece starts building intensity as the Donkey prepares to sing to the Jackal’s dismay. The figures in Bar 108 and 110 are the jackal calls and are again a reference to the jackal calls in “The Blue Jackal” (played by the trombones in that piece). Those calls signify the Jackal pleading with the Donkey to not sing. The Donkey, however, starts singing its melody in bar 112. The piece ends with the donkey braying in agony as it was caught in the farm.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
*(Disclaimer) I want to specify that I acknowledge the existence of the various forms of Middle Eastern music that have been employing the quarter tone system for centuries, hence I do not claim to be doing anything novel with this scale or idea. I would also like to specify that this scale would only sound “odd” to people who have exclusively been exposed to western music or other music forms that do not employ quarter-tones.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
** This scale can also be approximated as “2ED(4/3)” or 2-Equal-Divisions of the perfect 4th as the Perfect 4th in 12-TET is nearly perfect when compared to the harmonic series. ",,,3'

,15,No One's an Island ✦ For 11 Horns,2022,"all, chamber","Solo French Horn, 10 Accompanying French Horns",French Horn,"Piece was performed on 11th November 2022.<br>&nbsp;<br>
The title “No One’s an Island” was inspired by the evocative poem “No Man’s an Island” by 16th Century Poet “John Donne”. The poem serves as a reminder that no human in society is self-sufficient, and how we are where we are because of the people around us. <br>&nbsp;<br>
The poem reads:
<br>&nbsp;<br>
“No man is an island entire of itself; every man <br>
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; <br>
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe <br>
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as <br>
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine <br>
own were; any man's death diminishes me, <br>
because I am involved in mankind. <br>
And therefore never send to know for whom <br>
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.”
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The poem resonates with my personal emotions based on recent events, and I decided to write a piece on this topic to express gratitude to the people around me who have helped me through tough times. The soloist in the piece represents the protagonist, with the accompanying 10 horns acting as company, friends, or relatives. <br>&nbsp;<br>
The piece starts with the soloist playing a short motif with the other horns echoing after the soloist. This is to signify the soloist in despair as they think that they have to suffer alone through their hardships and all their calls for help merely echo into the distance. This is followed by the soloist introducing the main theme of the piece played in natural horn. The echoing concept is further explored as the piece progresses. The piece musically expresses the accompanying horns trying to help the soloist while the soloist avoids and rejects it as they are adamant to deal with the ordeal by themselves. However, the staggering and echoing horns slowly converge until finally all the accompanying horns and the soloist are playing together in harmony and with identical rhythms to signify the acceptance of asking for and receiving help. <br>&nbsp;<br>

I had a lot of fun writing his piece but I had even more fun rehearsing and performing it as all 9 players are very close friends of mine. We are all clarinet players in the St. Olaf Band, so this, in some way, is a celebration of my lovely clarinet section in band.
 <br>&nbsp;<br>
The title of the piece is actually a combination of 2 languages, ""Taqsim"" is an Arabic word which in the context of music refers to a form which involves improvisational passages and recurring theme. ""Nach"" simple means dance in Hindi. Pieces in Arabic and Turkish and other middle eastern music are often titled this way (""Taqsim ___""). The title perfectly sums up the mixture of influences stemming from my deep appreciation of Arabic and Turkish music and my Indian heritage.
 <br>&nbsp;<br>
Taking a lot of inspiration from Arabic and Turkish music, I used maqams which use quarter tones (In this case, I used Maqam Bayati and altered it occasionally). Unsurprisingly, they're very hard on clarinet and require embouchure manipulation and alternate fingerings. My friends worked very hard to practice those quarter tones for my piece and I am super pleased with the result. I also took inspiration from Klezmer music with some scales and rhythm. Hope you enjoy my piece!

A very special thanks to Prof. Scott Anderson. He's the clarinet prof at St. Olaf College and he oversaw most of the rehearsals and provided invaluable advice and support so the piece could be performed well. (He also really helped out with the smears and the quarter tones).",https://www.youtube.com/embed/hCBY7gyjIvY?si=1zDmpMJG7RdqHLRp,,"5' 15"""
