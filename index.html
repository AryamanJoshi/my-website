            <span class="hindi_body">नमस्ते,</span> 
            <span class="japanese_body">こんにちは,</span> 
            <span class="urdu_body">السلام عليكم,</span>
            <span class="english_body"> and </span> 
            <span class="hindi_body">Hello!!</span> <br>
            <span class="english_body">I’m Aryaman Manish Joshi and music is my lifeblood. 
            I have been in awe with how India has grown by leaps and bounds over
            the last 5 years. I am not just talking economically, but also in terms 
                of music, art, culture and education. This has given me the urge to give back
                to my homeland and contribute to changing the landscape of concert and performance
                music in India. While this sounds ambitious, I know that having consistent goals 
                and an unconditional love for your community and craft along with an eager and bustling
                population can bring about any changes we dream for.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="english_body"> I started my musical journey at the age of 9 when I started my piano lessons. Since then, I have been 
                hooked and through the piano explored various genres of music. I experienced the prestigious and vast 
                western classical musical canon, played in pop, rock, and metal bands and involved myself in more communal forms of
                music like playing in church choirs. While I knew I loved music, I wasn’t sure if it was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life as 
                I was faring well in school (especially maths) and was considering other paths in life too.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="english_body"> At age 17, I decided I wanted to go abroad for college as courses abroad allowed me to continue studying maths and music in 
                parallel without having to give any one of them up. I ended up joining St. Olaf College in 2019 and graduated in 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts 
                with a double major in Music Composition and Mathematics with a minor in statistics and data science. This was the best decision 
                I could’ve made as while I had a good STEM experience, I found my true calling in music composition. I wrote a lot of music, had 
                many successful performances, got many commissions and also dabbled in a lot of different musical instruments and ensembles. My 
                narrow musical mind was expanded in directions I didn’t know existed, yet I still feel like I have barely scratched the surface. In 
                this document, I have provided tables which elucidate my composition, ensemble, and instrument experience. Please note that the 
                titles of the pieces are links to YouTube videos and the program notes of the pieces are in the description box of the video.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="english_body"> I believe I can provide a unique musical perspective with my diverse (and admittedly,
                often niche/obscure) musical experiences. I want to collaborate with the budding and 
                often untapped talent in our country. It’s about time our symphony orchestras play more 
                than just Mozart and Beethoven, our marching bands sound more than a mere image of 
                British band music, and more children and adults get involved in ensemble music with 
                little to no barriers of entry. I want to work with you.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="english_body"> Please feel free to reach out to me with the provided contacts. Thank you so much and I 
                look forward to hearing from you!</span> 
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="english_body"> Regards, Aryaman.</span>
